      <h3><span class="highlight">The Problem</span></h3>
      <p>In this age of digital tech, cameras are everywhere. Taking a picture is so easy now, but the real issue is how to share these photos in a convenient and efficient way. As an avid traveller, I love going on trips and taking photos. But, at the end of every trip, I spend hours uploading my images, distributing them with others, and downloading other people’s pictures. As a personal project with friends, I decided to create an app that provides a fast and convenient way for users to upload, distribute, and download images while also improving my technical skills.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="container intro">
      <h3><span class="highlight">Why</span></h3>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, illum definitiones no quo, maluisset concludaturque et eum, altera Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, illum definitiones no quo, maluisset concludaturque et eum, altera Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, illum definitiones no quo, maluisset concludaturque et eum, altera Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, illum definitiones no quo, maluisset concludaturque et eum, altera Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, illum definitiones no quo, maluisset concludaturque et eum, altera Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, illum definitiones no quo, maluisset concludaturque et eum, altera </p>
      <p>Photo sharing can be a huge hassle. Pre-existing platforms such as google photos or dropbox all require accounts and a good amount of setup. Our goal was to provide a lightweight service for sharing as conveniently as possible. This means no remembering sign up credentials, no time spent on profile information, and no dealing with spam emails.</p>
    </div> 
     
    <!-- research section -->
    <div class="container intro">
      <h3><span class="highlight">Research</span></h3>
      <p>Research on current photo-sharing issues and existing services were conducted to investigate common problems users face and understand their photo-sharing experience. We also developed a survey and created personas to collect more user information and gauge our potential user base.</p>

    <!-- user research subsection -->
    <div class="subsection">
      <h4>&thinsp; User Research</h4>
    </div>
    <p>To better understand our users and guide us through the decision-making process, we researched issues that the general public might face when sharing photos and conducted a small scale survey within my local community about their photo-sharing experience.</p>
    <p>After reading through various forums and user posts, I noticed that many people have frustrations with: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Waiting for others to upload their images</li>
      <li>Confusing navigation system</li>
      <li>Not comfortable with sharing/asking for information</li>
      <li>Compression of images</li>
      <li>Concern with privacy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Interestingly, majority of people who posted were parents and adults. We anticipated a large part of our target audience would be young adults and college students because many young adults enjoy travelling, prefer not to waste any time on unnecessary actions, and typically take a long time sendimg out group pictures. 
    Most wanted to share photos of children with relatives, share wedding photos with guests, share photos with signficant others, or consolidate vacation photos.</p>

    <a href="../CZ_Resume.pdf" target="_blank"> <img class="link-img" src="../images/unlink.png">&thinsp;Survey Link</a>
    <p>Furthermore, we conducted a survey with six participants within our local community. They were asked several questions regarding their photo sharing habits and experiences with others. When asked, 4 participants responded that they had experienced previous dissatisfaction with friends and family members not sharing photos after a trip in a timely manner. These participants estimated that on average, it took up to a week for photos to be received from all members of the party, with upper bounds of up to 2-3 weeks in some cases. We also asked about potential factors that prevent users from wanting to share photos immediately. One response was that “when the trip is over, I don’t feel as motivated to upload pictures when I go back to my daily routine of work again”. Several others also mentioned that it was easy for them to “forget to do it” after a while. </p>
    <p style="color: lightgray; font-style: italic; font-size: 12px;">*Note: the data from the survey may be biased as the participants were predominantly college students.</p>

      <h4>&thinsp; Competitor Research</h4>

    <p>To understand why the listed user issues exist and persist, I researched current and alternative platforms many users use. There's a wide variety of services and platforms people use ranging from group messages to shared cloud services to private sharing apps.</p>

    <p>However, many of these platforms currently: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>require an account to be made or are connected to social media</li>
      <li>gather the information of other users, such as email or phone number</li>
      <li>require the user to specifically select which photos to upload</li>
      <li>only enable the user to download images one by one</li>
      <li>may compress the image quality</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although some platforms are easy to use and quick, they typically require an associated account or are not designed for photo sharing specifically. Storage cloud based services, such as Google Drive and Dropbox, are for general storage purposes and can complicate photo organization. On the other hand, social media platforms have the issue of privacy since most people consider photos as personal content and prefer sharing them with associated people instead of everyone. Messaging platforms, such as Facebook Messenger and Viber, may compress image quality and only enable the user to save images one by one. Furthermore, sites designed for displaying photos and photo sharing might not necessarily work well for those who only want to share material with close people. For example, Flickr and Smugmug both allow sharing of photos for casual use but also offer services for professional photographers, such as publicizing user image galleries. Most commonly used service is Google Photos for its easy usage, commonality, and optimzation for image organization.</p>

      <h4>&thinsp; Personas</h4>
    </div>
    <p>To better understand who our users might be, I created 2 personas based off of the research conducted and from the insights gained through user forums. These personas represent different contexts in which various people might want to use an app to share photos with those close to them. </p>
    <div class="container persona">
      <div class="row justify-content-center"> 
        <div class="col-5 mx-auto justify-content-center text-center">

          <img class="persona-img" src="../images/keith.png" alt="keith">
          <div class="container text-left">
            <p>Keith has worked as a biotech researcher for many years. He’s never gotten around to using social media apps and uses his phone to check the occasional email. His recent company retreat has given him several memories that he wishes to look back on, but his colleagues aren’t avid phone users either.</p>
          </div>        
        </div>

        <div class="col-5 mx-auto justify-content-center text-center">
          <h5> Meet Emily</h5>
          <img class="persona-img" src="../images/emily.png" alt="emily">
          <div class="container text-left">
            <p>Emily just started college and ended up taking many pictures with her family during her spring break. Soon, Emily and her siblings will be rushing back to their own busy lives, so she wants to easily exchange photos with them before they go.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
     </div>
    
     <p>Despite differing backgrounds of Keith and Emily, both share the common goal of easily sharing photos with those close to them. As photo sharing can be quite confusing and time consuming, many of participants I interviewed also expressed the desire to share photos in an easy and quick way.</p>
