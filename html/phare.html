      <h3><span class="highlight">The Problem</span></h3>
      <p>In this age of digital tech, cameras are everywhere. Taking a picture is so easy now, but the real issue is how to share these photos in a convenient and efficient way. As an avid traveller, I love going on trips and taking photos. But at the end of every trip, I spend hours uploading my images, distributing them with others, and downloading other people’s pictures.
    </div>

    <div class="container intro">
      <h3><span class="highlight">Why</span></h3>
      <p>Photo sharing can be a huge hassle. Pre-existing platforms such as google photos or dropbox all require accounts and a good amount of setup. Our goal was to provide a lightweight service for sharing as conveniently as possible. This means no remembering sign up credentials, no time spent on profile information, and no dealing with spam emails.</p>
    </div> 
     
    <!-- research section -->
    <div class="container intro">
      <h3><span class="highlight">Research</span></h3>
      <p>Research on current photo-sharing issues and existing services was conducted to investigate common problems users face and understand their photo-sharing experience. We also developed a survey and created user personas to collect more information and gauge our potential user base.</p>

    <!-- user research subsection -->
    <div class="subsection">
      <h4>&thinsp; User Research</h4>
    </div>
    <p>We researched issues that the general public might face when sharing photos and conducted a small scale survey within my local community about their photo-sharing experience.</p>
    <p>After reading through various forums and user posts, I noticed that many people have frustrations with: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Waiting for others to upload their images</li>
      <li>Taking too long to upload images</li>
      <li>Not comfortable with sharing/asking for information</li>
      <li>Compression of image quality</li>
      <li>Concern with privacy</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Interestingly, the majority of people who posted were parents and adults. Most wanted to share photos of children with relatives, wedding photos with guests, photos with significant others, or consolidate vacation photos. We anticipated a large part of our target audience would be young adults and college students because many young adults enjoy travelling, prefer not to waste any time on unnecessary actions, and typically take a long time sending out group pictures. 
    </p>

    <a href="https://forms.gle/5yjsjup5A5b3aUXe8" target="_blank"> <img class="link-img" src="../images/unlink.png">&thinsp;Survey Link</a> +

    <p>To obtain more detailed responses and assess people's photo sharing preferences, we conducted a survey with 7 participants within our local community. They were asked several questions regarding their photo sharing habits and experiences with others. Most participates use a form of messenging app and Google Drive to share images. On average, it takes up to a week for photos to be received from all members of the party, with upper bounds of a few weeks in some cases. We also asked about potential factors that prevent users from wanting to share photos immediately. Several responded that selecting and uploading images online took too long. One response was that “when the trip is over, I don’t feel as motivated to upload pictures when I go back to my daily routine of work again.” Interestingly, many liked the idea of Apple's airdrop feature and wished it may work for longer distances. However, it is important to note that the participants of the survey were predominately university students, which introduces bias to the data. </p>

    <p>I created 2 personas based off of the research conducted and from the insights gained through user forums to better understand who our users might be. These personas represent different contexts in which various people might want to use an app to share photos with those close to them. </p>

    <p>Many of these platforms currently: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>require an account to be made or are connected to social media</li>
      <li>gather the information of other users, such as email or phone number</li>

      <li>only enable the user to download images one by one</li>
      <li>may compress the image quality</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although some platforms are easy to use and quick, they typically require an associated account or are not designed for photo sharing specifically. Cloud based services, such as Google Drive and Dropbox, are for general storage purposes and can complicate photo organization. On the other hand, social media platforms have the issue of privacy since most people consider photos as personal content and prefer sharing them with associated people instead of everyone. Messaging platforms, such as Facebook Messenger and Viber, may compress image quality and only enable the user to save images one by one. Furthermore, sites designed for displaying photos and photo sharing might not necessarily work well for those who only want to share material with close people. For example, Flickr and Smugmug both allow sharing of photos for casual use but also offer services for professional photographers, such as publicizing user image galleries. Most of these platforms and services are not designed to focus on photo sharing and uploading, which can bring confusion to new users and take up their time. Google Photos seems to be the most favored service due to its easy usage, commonality, and optimization for image organization.

        The collected data suffers from bias and may not be representative of the general public.

        <h4>&thinsp; Ideation</h4>
      </div>
      <p>The app started off with the idea that users could join servers where images would be automatically uploaded onto these servers. Other people could join these servers to view, download, and upload images through an encrypted access code. Joinable servers would not require the user to gather others’ emails or numbers while avoiding having to configure viewing permission settings. Users would be able to easily generate an invite to the server and others would be able to access the server through a simple code. </p>

      <!--<p>IMG?</p>-->

      <p>From there, we focused on the minimum functionality required to get the job done. This was to ensure that we did not bombard users with unnecessary features. For example, although an account would be ideal for cross-device usage, most people take photos on 1 personal device. We realized that setting up an account, while not too time consuming, were still steps that we could cut out for convenience. Except for a name and an optional profile picture, email, birthdays, and other forms of information were not needed. Ultimately, we decided against chatting, commentating, and reacting features. Although we realize those features promote interactivity among users, we believe this would cause Phare to resemble a social media app and stray away from our focus of efficient photo sharing.</p>

      <p>
          As a reacp, Phare aims to provide a quick and convenient way for people to share photos with others for time based events. Phare avoids the hassle of account creation, image selection, and asking for information through joinable servers that automatically queue up photos within a specified time frame. Due to this, users are not able to view their servers across devices and can only stores their photos on their local device. As photos are commonly taken on phones, Phare is a mobile first app that focuses on fast upload, download, and transfer.

          Ideally, we would like to develop dynamic albums that will automatically upload images based on facial recognition to decrease image selection time. We also would like to make it so users can be active in multiple servers and control when to start and end each session for better flexibility and transparency.
